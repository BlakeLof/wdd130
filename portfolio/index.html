                <p>My name is Blake Lofgreen and I am a current student at Brigham Young University -Idaho studying Software Engineering. I am currently a Senior and am looking for a full-time entry level position. I completed my internship with Pathway Worldwide as their Asset Management. This was an open office position that had high professional standards. My recent position was acting as a technical specialist for the Polytechnic campus of Arizona State University. Through my classes I have been trained in Object Oriented Programming, Website Design, Calculus, Engineering, Debugging, and Project Management Structures.
                    I first started my college life enrolled in Information Technology, focusing on the physical aspects of computers. This was great but I wanted to learn more about what makes computers work. I changed my major to Software Engineering in 2018 at Ensign College and completed my Associates with them in 2020. I prefer backend work on projects but am open to full stack or frontend. Some of the projects I have completed include game design, stock tracking, android mobile apps, and database configurating. I specialize in Java, C/C++, and Python.
