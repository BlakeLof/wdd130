                <p>As stated in my introduction I have completed an associate degree in Software Engineering and am currently enrolled to complete my Bachelor’s. Through these degree programs I have completed many class projects ranging from game design to stock tracking webpages. These programs mainly used Java, Python, and JavaScript. The development structure used for these projects was Agile and utilized the Scrum Method.
                    My past job experience includes customer service, computer testing, maintenance on computers, and retail sales. My most recent positions involved maintaining and deploying computers for both Arizona State University and BYU-Pathway. As a technology specialist for ASU, I worked on a team made up of other Software Engineering students that would go around campus for support tickets from professors and tasks handed down from our higher ups. While the asset management position for BYU-Pathway required me to work solo on site and converse with supervisors from main offices of the higher organization. This asset job had me maintain the main offices for Pathway, including their customer support center of over 80 computers, their main staff, and their executive office. This position also required that I oversaw my own hours and organize my workday around the tasks handed down from my supervisors.
