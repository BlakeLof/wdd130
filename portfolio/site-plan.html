      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My proposed idea is a portfolio for my professional career. 
        The parent page will give an introduction of myself, while the child pages will contain experience, resume, and projects on its own separate page. 
        This website would act as an online resume that I can have companies look at and get to know my personal and professional life better.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
My name is Blake Lofgreen and I am a current student at Brigham Young University -Idaho studying Software Engineering. I am currently a Senior and am looking for a full-time entry level position. I completed my internship with Pathway Worldwide as their Asset Management. This was an open office position that had high professional standards. My recent position was acting as a technical specialist for the Polytechnic campus of Arizona State University. Through my classes I have been trained in Object Oriented Programming, Website Design, Calculus, Engineering, Debugging, and Project Management Structures.
 I first started my college life enrolled in Information Technology, focusing on the physical aspects of computers. This was great but I wanted to learn more about what makes computers work. I changed my major to Software Engineering in 2018 at Ensign College and completed my Associates with them in 2020. I prefer backend work on projects but am open to full stack or frontend. Some of the projects I have completed include game design, stock tracking, android mobile apps, and database configurating. I specialize in Java, C/C++, and Python. 
</p>
 <h3>Personal Life</h3>
<p>
I am from Show Low, Arizona, which is a small town found in the mountains of eastern Arizona. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in which I was raised in. I am honest, hard- working, and caring towards those around me. I come from a big family of 11, where I fall in the middle. I was raised in humble circumstances, in a small town distant from any major city and where the top local career was working as a home contractor. I spent most of my high school years in science, music and performing clubs. I have lived in varying places from Salt Lake City, Utah to Gilbert, AZ. I completed a two-year voluntary mission to New Hampshire and Maine for my church. I enjoy all seasons and prefer a temperate climate to live. 
My hobbies include woodworking, tabletop board games, playing the violin and guitar, Magic: The Gathering, all types of video games, computer building, snowboarding, and baking. I’m a hands-on person who enjoys experimenting with procedures and designs. As a youth I would be inquisitive about the workings of my family’s technology, and I would take them fully apart and put them back together. I spend most of my current time working on homework and projects for my bachelor’s degree.
</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>
As stated in my introduction I have completed an associate degree in Software Engineering and am currently enrolled to complete my Bachelor’s. Through these degree programs I have completed many class projects ranging from game design to stock tracking webpages. These programs mainly used Java, Python, and JavaScript. The development structure used for these projects was Agile and utilized the Scrum Method.
My past job experience includes customer service, computer testing, maintenance on computers, and retail sales. My most recent positions involved maintaining and deploying computers for both Arizona State University and BYU-Pathway. As a technology specialist for ASU, I worked on a team made up of other Software Engineering students that would go around campus for support tickets from professors and tasks handed down from our higher ups. While the asset management position for BYU-Pathway required me to work solo on site and converse with supervisors from main offices of the higher organization. This asset job had me maintain the main offices for Pathway, including their customer support center of over 80 computers, their main staff, and their executive office. This position also required that I oversaw my own hours and organize my workday around the tasks handed down from my supervisors
