            <section class="msg2">
                <p>I am from Show Low, Arizona, which is a small town found in the mountains of eastern Arizona. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in which I was raised in. I am honest, hard- working, and caring towards those around me. I come from a big family of 11, where I fall in the middle. I was raised in humble circumstances, in a small town distant from any major city and where the top local career was working as a home contractor. I spent most of my high school years in science, music and performing clubs. I have lived in varying places from Salt Lake City, Utah to Gilbert, AZ. I completed a two-year voluntary mission to New Hampshire and Maine for my church. I enjoy all seasons and prefer a temperate climate to live. 
                    My hobbies include woodworking, tabletop board games, playing the violin and guitar, Magic: The Gathering, all types of video games, computer building, snowboarding, and baking. I’m a hands-on person who enjoys experimenting with procedures and designs. As a youth I would be inquisitive about the workings of my family’s technology, and I would take them fully apart and put them back together. I spend most of my current time working on homework and projects for my bachelor’s degree.
